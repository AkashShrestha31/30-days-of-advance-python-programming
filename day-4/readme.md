1. **Importing the threading Module:**
   The code starts by importing the `threading` module, which provides the tools necessary for multi-threading in Python.

2. **BankAccount Class:**
   This class simulates a bank account. It has two main methods: `deposit` and `withdraw`, and it includes a `lock` to ensure thread-safe access to the account balance.

   - **`__init__` Method:** The constructor initializes the account balance to zero and creates a `lock` using `threading.Lock()`.

   - **`deposit` Method:** This method takes an `amount` argument and simulates depositing funds into the account. It uses the `lock` to ensure that only one thread can modify the balance at a time.

   - **`withdraw` Method:** Similar to `deposit`, this method takes an `amount` argument and simulates withdrawing funds from the account while ensuring thread safety.

3. **`account_transactions` Function:**
   This function simulates a series of account transactions, consisting of multiple deposits and withdrawals. It accepts a `BankAccount` instance as an argument.

4. **Main Block:**
   The following steps are executed when the script is run as the main program:

   - An instance of `BankAccount` named `account` is created.

   - Two threads, `thread1` and `thread2`, are created, both targeting the `account_transactions` function and passing the `account` instance as an argument.

   - Both threads are started using the `start()` method, allowing them to run concurrently.

   - The `join()` method is called on both threads to wait for them to finish their transactions before proceeding.

   - Finally, the script prints the final account balance after all transactions.

5. **Thread Safety and Lock Usage:**
   The use of locks (`acquire()` and `release()`) within the `deposit` and `withdraw` methods ensures that only one thread can access and modify the account balance at a time. This prevents data corruption that could occur if multiple threads modify the balance simultaneously.

6. **Concurrent Transactions:**
   The two threads (`thread1` and `thread2`) simulate concurrent account transactions, including deposits and withdrawals. The use of locks ensures that these transactions are performed in a thread-safe manner.

By using locks, the code ensures that the shared resource (the account balance) is accessed in a way that avoids race conditions and maintains data consistency, even in a multi-threaded environment. The example highlights how locks can be used to synchronize access to shared resources, preventing potential issues that arise when multiple threads interact with data concurrently.

Steps to run a Python code file named `multithreading_example.py`:

- Open a Terminal (Command Prompt on Windows).

- Navigate to the directory where `multithreading_example.py` is located using the `cd` command.

- Run the script using the `python` command:

  ```
  python multithreading_example.py
  ```

- Observe the output in the Terminal as the script runs.

- Wait for the script to finish executing.

That's it! You've successfully run your `multithreading_example.py` script.



# Download file using Multithreading
```python
import threading
import requests

def download_and_save_file(url, file_index):
    """
    Download a file from the given URL and save it with an index-based filename.
    
    Args:
        url (str): The URL of the file to be downloaded.
        file_index (int): Index for generating the filename.
    """
    print(f"Starting downloading file at index {file_index}")
    
    response = requests.get(url)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        with open(f"images/file_{file_index}.jpg", "wb") as file:
            file.write(response.content)
        print(f"Download completed for file at index {file_index}")
    else:
        print("Error loading file")
    

if __name__ == "__main__":
    threads = []
    file_url = "https://picsum.photos/200/300"
    
    for index in range(10):
        thread = threading.Thread(target=download_and_save_file, args=(file_url, index))
        thread.start()
        threads.append(thread)
        
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()

```
The provided code is a Python script that demonstrates how to use multi-threading to download and save multiple image files concurrently from a given URL. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. **Importing Libraries:**
   - `import threading`: Imports the `threading` module, which provides tools for working with threads.
   - `import requests`: Imports the `requests` library, which is used to send HTTP requests.

2. **Defining the Function:**
   - `def download_and_save_file(url, file_index):` - Defines a function named `download_and_save_file` that takes two parameters: `url` (the URL of the file to download) and `file_index` (an index for generating the filename).

3. **Function Explanation:**
   - The function's purpose is to download an image file from the provided URL and save it with a filename based on the `file_index`.

4. **Downloading and Saving File:**
   - Inside the function, it prints a message indicating that the download is starting.
   - It sends an HTTP GET request using `requests.get(url)` to retrieve the content of the specified URL.
   - If the response status code is `200` (indicating success):
     - It opens a new file with a filename like `"images/file_{file_index}.jpg"` in binary write mode.
     - Writes the content of the response (the image) to the file.
     - Prints a message indicating that the download is completed.
   - If the response status code is not `200`, it prints an error message.

5. **Main Execution:**
   - The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to ensure that the code inside it is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module in another script.

6. **Creating Threads:**
   - `threads = []`: Initializes an empty list to store the thread objects.
   - `file_url = "https://picsum.photos/200/300"`: Defines the URL of the image files to download.
   - The code then enters a loop that runs 10 times (`for index in range(10):`).
   - Inside the loop:
     - Creates a new thread object named `thread` using `threading.Thread(target=download_and_save_file, args=(file_url, index))`.
     - Starts the thread using `thread.start()`.
     - Appends the thread object to the `threads` list.

7. **Waiting for Threads to Finish:**
   - After creating and starting all the threads, the script enters another loop to wait for each thread to finish its execution (`for thread in threads:`).
   - `thread.join()` is called on each thread, which blocks the script's execution until the thread has completed.

The script essentially creates 10 threads, each downloading an image from the specified URL and saving it with a unique filename based on the index. By using multi-threading, the script can download multiple images concurrently, potentially improving the overall speed of the process.
